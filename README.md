# Self-Organising_Maps_for_Origins_of_Speech_Sounds
(bachelor thesis)

By Steppe Flynn
(Supervised by Peter Dekker & Bart De Boer)

This code presents a cognitive model (self-organizing map) that can be used to determine factors that may influence the origin of speech sounds. It is based on the 2005 paper written by Oudeyer. Our results were not the ones as described by Oudeyer but it serves as a starting point for further research and we believe the results will improve once the model can be tested more extensively.


Requirements:

Python 3.8


Installs: 

matplotlib
numpy
random
minisom
mesa


The model can be started using the Python notebook that comes included. Starting parameters can also be fine-tuned here.
